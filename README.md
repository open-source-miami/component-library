# Open Source Miami's Component Library 
[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-1-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors)

A React component library created so that we could standardize the design and behavior throughout all of our sites and products. We don't plan to make a full component library like Material, or Bootstrap. We are just planning to make whatever is needed to complete our projects, and accumulate all of the components over time.

## Storybook

This project is utilizing a JavaScript Library called [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) which is, "an open source tool for developing UI component in isolation for React, Vue, and Angular." This UI allows us to catalog all of our components and documentation in one place. Storybook runs alongside your app in development mode.

Building the UI Components first follows a [Component-Driven Development](https://blog.hichroma.com/component-driven-development-ce1109d56c8e) methodology. 

To start building components with Storybook, take a look at the documentation [here](https://www.learnstorybook.com/react/en/simple-component/)


## Getting Started - Local Development

If you have Node and Typescript installed on your system getting started should be fairly simple. 


1. Clone or Fork [the repo](https://github.com/open-source-miami/component-library)

```sh

        git clone https://github.com/open-source-miami/component-library.git

```

2. Install node modules

```sh

        npm install

```

3. Run Projects locally

```sh

        npm run start

```

The script should open the local version of our component storybook in your default browser.

If you need additional information about setting up your development environment take a look at our [setup doc](./docs/setup.md). 

## Contributing
