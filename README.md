# Open Source Miami's Component Library
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e19d8b1e-882e-4c7a-9db4-170665a7aaff/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/osmiami-lib/deploys)

[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-1-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors)

A React component library created so that we could standardize the design and behavior throughout all of our sites and products. The objective is not to make a full component library like Material, or Bootstrap. We are just planning to make whatever is needed to complete our projects, and accumulate all of the components over time.

## Storybook

This project is utilizing a JavaScript Library called [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) which is, "an open source tool for developing UI component in isolation for React, Vue, and Angular." This UI allows us to catalog all of our components and documentation in one place. Storybook runs alongside your app in development mode.

Building the UI Components first follows a [Component-Driven Development](https://blog.hichroma.com/component-driven-development-ce1109d56c8e) methodology. 

To start building components with Storybook, take a look at the documentation [here](https://www.learnstorybook.com/react/en/simple-component/)


## Getting Started - Local Development

If you have Node and Typescript installed on your system getting started should be fairly simple. 


1. Clone or Fork [the repo](https://github.com/open-source-miami/component-library) (Should you clone or fork the repo? Checkout [Contributing](#contributing))

```sh

        git clone https://github.com/open-source-miami/component-library.git

```

2. Install node modules

```sh

        npm install

```

3. Run Projects locally

```sh

        npm run start

```

The script should open the local version of our component storybook in your default browser. If all is well you should see our storybook on http://localhost:6006/

If you need additional information about setting up your development environment take a look at our [setup doc](./docs/setup.md). 

## Deploying this project

The static version of the site is going to be deployed to [Netlify]((https://www.netlify.com/). Netlify makes it incredibly easy to deploy just give it authorization to access the repo, and let it know how to build the static files, in our case:

```sh
        npm run build-storybook
```

Then you just tell it where the static files are going to be stored, with most projects it would be called `build` or `dist`, but for this project static files are stored under `storybook-static`.

See the status of our latest deployment: [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e19d8b1e-882e-4c7a-9db4-170665a7aaff/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/osmiami-lib/deploys)

Our site is hosted [here](https://osmiami-lib.netlify.com/)
