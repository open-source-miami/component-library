# Contributing

We need everything from docs, design, code, devops, project management, and any type of motivation to keep this project going. If you would like to make any type of contribution to the library feel free to make a PR or get in touch any of the members of the org.

Right now we are using Trello to track all of the features we are trying to develop along with the issues we are tracking. Feel free to pick any of these tasks up and make it your own.

We are drafting up a design using a tool called Figma, which lets us comment, and collaborate on designs kind of like Google Docs.

You could find any of the members of the org on Spectrum chat and on Slack, right now we are using Slack as the main form of communication and collaboration.

If you have never contributed to an open source project, and have a few minutes to watch a few videos take a look at [this short course](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) by Kent C Dodds.

In summary if you would like to contribute to the project you are going to either have to join the organization's repo, or you will need to fork one of our repos, and make a pull request to the project. Make sure that your fork is up to date, with our branch before making a pull request to avoid merge conflicts. 

If all this sounds foreign to you, I would advise you to watch the tutorials above. ðŸ˜Š
